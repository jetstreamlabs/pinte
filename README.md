## Introduction

**Pinte** is an less opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists. Pinte is built on top of **[PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)** and makes it simple to ensure that your code style stays **clean** and **consistent**.

Pinte is almost completely based on [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) with the added configuration (to start) of indentation and line endings which are a much requested feature.

If there are other configuration additions you'd like added please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Pinte is forthcoming.
